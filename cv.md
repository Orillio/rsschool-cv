## My summary
I started to learn IT stuff around 8 months ago. I always liked this kind of activity, but i wasnt into this. Then i realized that i want to bond my life with programming.
Later i started to learn my second programming language `C#`. It's very simple unlike `C++`, so i falled in love with it. Now i understand and practice big stack of .NET technologies.
My goal is to learn more about `JS` and native technologies. RS School is a great opportunity to get this forbidden JavaScript knowledge.
